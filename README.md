Author's Comment The game winner/loser feature works seamlessly on the localhost during development. However, I have experienced some difficulties after hosting the application, If you have issues running the game, Installing dependencies etc, I advice you convert it to js or use the js version on the repository. I am actively working to resolve these issues and appreciate your patience.
